# Title  : Identification of Musical Instrument and Human Speakers based on Audio Analysis and Pattern Recognition Techniques. 

This is my MTech thesis code (done in 2017-2018). Thesis is uploaded in https://archive.org/details/shruti-sarika-chakraborty-identification-of-musical-instrument-and-human-speakers-based/page/n7/mode/2up
Abstract : This study addresses two key challenges in 
audio signal analysis: musical instrument classification 
and open-set speaker identification. For instrument 
classification, we compare six acoustic features and 
four classification algorithms (ANN, SVM, K-NN, 
Random Forest) across five instrument groups. Results 
demonstrate that cepstral coefficients combined with 
artificial neural networks achieve optimal classification 
accuracy, independent of pitch variations. For speaker 
identification, we develop a novel system using MFCC 
features, Random Forest classification, and a multi
input Random Forest regressor to automatically 
determine classification thresholds. This approach 
effectively distinguishes between known and unknown 
speakers without manual threshold selection, 
advancing open-set text-independent speaker 
recognition. 

Code Information :  Codes and Datasets are arranged in separate folders for clear visiblity.
'CODES' contains function-specific implementations, while 'DATASET' houses relevant input data. 
Each directory includes clear documentation detailing code functionality and dataset descriptions for easy navigation and understanding.
